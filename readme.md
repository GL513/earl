He responds and reacts to certain phrases, words, and the like, to try to help uplift and motivate your community.
Earl is a project developed by Breadpudding (Alex) and his friends out of their passion to create.

# What does this bot do?
Earl uses RegEx string matching to recognize respond or react to phrases and words.
Earl runs idley and waits for a matching pattern from his patterns.yml YAML file to appear, and then responds with the corrosponding response or maybe even reaction emoji.
