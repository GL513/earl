# Regex patterns that the bot matches against. If a pattern matches, the bot
# sends a response and passes the capture groups to the Python string formatter.
# So if you include {0} in a response, it will be replaced by the first capture
# group from the regex expression. If a response starts with a plus sign, the
# rest of the response will be treated as an emoji(either as Unicode or as a
# Discord snowflake) and will react to the message that triggered it. ~Alex
